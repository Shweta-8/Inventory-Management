# Inventory Management System

## Project Overview üöÄ
This project is a **SQL-based Inventory Management System** designed to efficiently track suppliers, products, stock, customers, and orders. The system leverages well-structured database tables, stored procedures, and triggers to automate stock management and ensure data consistency.

## Project Highlights üèÜ
- ‚úÖ **Table Structures**: Well-designed schema for managing suppliers, products, orders, and stock.
- ‚úÖ **Stored Procedures**: Automates key actions such as order placement, stock updates, and customer management.
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: Ensures real-time stock updates when orders are placed or products are modified.

## Key Functionalities ‚öôÔ∏è
- üî∏ **Automatic Stock Deduction**: When an order is placed, the stock is automatically deducted.
- üî∏ **Stock Deletion**: Products are removed from inventory when they are deleted.
- üî∏ **Real-Time Synchronization**: Ensures real-time synchronization between orders and stock levels.

## Database Design üõ†Ô∏è
The system includes the following components:
- **Suppliers Table**: Stores vendor information with constraints to ensure data integrity.
- **Products Table**: Manages product details with category validation ('IT', 'HA', 'HC').
- **Stock Table**: Tracks inventory levels with reorder points and minimum order quantities.
- **Customer Table**: Maintains customer information with validation rules.
- **Orders Table**: Records all transactions linking customers to products.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram üìå
Below is the ER diagram showing primary and foreign key relationships:

    SUPPLIER ||--o{ PRODUCT : supplies
    PRODUCT ||--|| STOCK : has
    PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDERS : contains
    CUST ||--o{ ORDERS : places

    SUPPLIER {
        char(5) SID PK
        varchar(30) SNAME
        varchar(30) SADD
        varchar(5) SCITY
        char(15) SPHONE
        varchar(50) EMAIL
    }

    PRODUCT {

        int PRICE
        varchar(2) CATEGORY
        char(5) SID FK
    }

    STOCK {

        int SQTY
        int ROL
        int MOQ
    }

    CUST {
        char(5) CID PK
        varchar(50) CNAME
        varchar(50) CADDRESS
        varchar(50) CITY
        char(10) PHONE
        varchar(50) EMAIL
        date DOB
    }

    ORDERS {
        char(5) OID PK
        date ODATE
        char(5) PID FK
        char(5) CID FK
        int OQTY
    }

## How to Use ‚ö°
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:  
   Execute the provided SQL scripts to create the database structure, tables, and stored procedures:
   - `Table Creation.sql` - Creates the database schema and tables
   - `Procedures.sql` - Implements stored procedures for data operations
   - `Triggers.sql` - Sets up automation triggers for real-time updates

3. **Run the System**:  
   Use SQL commands to interact with the database (e.g., placing orders, checking stock levels, managing suppliers).

4. **Use Stored Procedures**:  
   The system includes the following procedures for easy data management:
   - `ADDSUPPLIER` - Creates new supplier records with auto-generated IDs
   - `ADDPRO` - Adds new products to the inventory
   - `ADDCUST` - Registers new customers in the system
   - `ADDORDER` - Processes new orders with automatic stock updates
